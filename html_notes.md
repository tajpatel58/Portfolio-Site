### Notes on Website Designs:

#### Basics:
- HTML = Hypertext Markup Language. 
- HTML code simply put is a webpage language that can be read by browsers. 
- Whenever we load a webpage, our browser (Safari/Chrome) is actually reading the HTML code and formatting accordingly. 
- "index.html" is a convention for naming the initial homepage of our website. 
- Tags are used to align and format text, images etc. An example would be a h1 tag which stands for HEADER1. 
- Also have metadata tags which doesn't make a difference in terms of the website but helps search engines find the webpage. 
- Always start with a HTML tag. 
- HTML is only used for viewing/previewing a page, combining with another language like JavaScript to add dynamic functionality. eg: linking website with a database, or doing something when a button is clicked. 
- CSS is used to style the website in terms of colour, dimensions of elements, padding etc. 

#### Different Tags:
- p tags for paragraphs. 
- Inline Elements: don't start a new line and take only the space necessary. 
- Block Elements: start a new line and occupies the full width available. 
- a tags are used for hyperlinks and have a keyword "href" which will be set to where we want the link to redirect to. a tags also have another keyword: target = "_blank" which says open a new tab when this link is clicked. Note: the formal name for these keywords are 'Tag Attributes'. They go within the tag itself note between the tags. Eg: <a href="https://google.com">Take me to Google<a/> 
- Lists can be started with a ul tag, and each bullet point should be within li tags. 
- ul tags are for bullet points, ol tags are used for numbered/ordered lists. 
- Form tags are essentially used to format a form submission, note that HTML can't be used for functionality, merely the look. Need some other language to add actual form functionality.
- Input tags allow the user to fill in data, has a tag attribute: type, dictating the type of the input. 
- Div tags are used to create a block element. 
- "placeholder" is a good tag attribute to fill in inputs until the user has inputted anything. 
- img tags used for images, has an "src" tag attribute so the browser knows where the picture is located. 

#### Semantic Tags: 
- Semantic tags include: header, footer, main, aisde, section. 
- They are used to add more structure to the website and format the webiste more accurately.
